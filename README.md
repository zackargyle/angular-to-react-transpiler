A transpiler to convert an angular project to React

There is a lot in common with Angular directives and React components, so I thought it would be cool to write a transpiler to convert a directive into a React component.

*** This is not even close to done. ***

Try it out:
```
> npm install
> node transpile.js --file demo/directive.js
```
